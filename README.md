# Util

## Description

Util is a website designed to make navigating all the school websites easier, by giving users a web navigation page that can take them anywhere the school may want them to go, and much more!

Websites include:

 - [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)
 - [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
 - [Aotea College Library](https://nz.accessit.online/ATC00/!#dashboard)
 - [NZQA](https://taku.nzqa.govt.nz/learner-home/)

## Installation

Before you can use Util, you must install it.
Installation is very simple, but there are 2 ways, depending on what you want to do. If you want to run it from inside a zip file, follow these instructions:

1. Install Util from your source.
2. Install XAMPP for your os (Windows, Linux).
3. Set up XAMPP.
4. Put the extracted .zip file into XAMPP's `htdocs` folder.
5. Navigate to `Util/Public/index.php`
6. Open `index.php`

And thats it! You can now navigate and use Util to it's fullest

I am developing a online version of Util, so that this Installation process is not needed, so hang on!
